# # Using Latex in Markdwon files
# Mohamed Badr

# You can use a latex like equations in markdown blocks by using the dollar sign ($$) before and after the equation. Find examples bellow: 

# $$
#     \int_0^\infty \frac{x^3}{e^x-1}\,dx = \frac{\pi^4}{15}
# $$

# Latex equations can also be written in the format of \begin and \end statements

# \begin{gather*}
# a_1=b_1+c_1\\
# a_2=b_2+c_2-d_2+e_2
# \end{gather*}
# 
# \begin{align}
# a_{11}& =b_{11}&
#   a_{12}& =b_{12}\\
# a_{21}& =b_{21}&
#   a_{22}& =b_{22}+c_{22}
# \end{align}
