    "This tutorial we use the U15 USA use tables and perform some analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we looked at the Supply Table for the US. Online, you find a Jupyter Notebook which imports the Supply Table, parses it (i.e., creates a variable that describes the part of the downloaded data that is of interest), and performs the sums to anser the questions. Please make sure you understand these operations. \n",
    "    \n",
    "In the first part of the present exercise, we import the US Use Table and prepare it for subsequent analysis by separating out relevant, distinct parts (parsing). Then we do some exploratory data analysis to get to know the use table. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like the supply table, the published use table comes with various sums of columns and rows. We are only interested in the primary data; python can do summations and so we do not need to have the data summed. Further, the use table has  distinct blocks: <br> \n",
    "    - the use of commodities as intermediate input by industries,  \n",
    "    - the use of factors of production (components of value added) by these industries, and  \n",
    "    - the use of commodities by final demand, which includes final consumption by households, non-governmental institutions serving households, the government, as well as export, investment, and storage.  \n",
    "    We identify those block and form the tables Use, Value Added, and FinalDemand. _Examine these tables and identify large flows_.<br><br> \n",
    "    <i>Q1: What is the sum total of each of those three matrices?</i><br>\n",
    "    <i>Q2: Determine and plot the total operating surplus of each industry sector.</i> What can we conclude from this? Why do you think it is called total operating surplus? What do costs do you think this surplus needs to cover? How is it different from profit?  \n",
    "    _Q3: Plot the compensation of employees_. How does the sector distribution differ from that of the surplus?  \n",
    "_Q4: Determine and plot the share of operating surplus in the value added in each sector._  \n",
    "    _Q5: What industries are using agricultural products as intermediate inputs? Make a plot._  \n",
    "    _Q6: Calculate the input coefficients (inputs per unit industry turnover). What commodities are used by all industries?_  \n",
    "    _Q7: Compare the demand for commodities by industry with the final demand._ Which commodities are primarily used by industries? Which are predominantly used by final consumers?\n",
