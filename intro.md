## Background

Environmental input-output analysis is a well-established method for environmental footprinting and sustainable development. The objective of this course is to introduce the method, as well as provide insight into two fields of applications. The first part of the course shows how data from the national accounts provides a basis for economic as well as environmental accounting. Based on this, the input-output framework is developed. It provides a method for identifying the production activities and analyzing the environmental impact of an arbitrary basket of goods as well as all domestic consumption. The second part of the course focuses on the application of input-output analysis to understand the material flows (MFA) within our society. Understanding this is becoming increasingly important to develop a sustainable society. The last part of the course addresses methods for analyzing environmental aspects of international trade and consumption using multi-regional input-output tables. This includes assessing environmental impacts associated with imported goods and services.

## Learning outcome

The course provides the student with knowledge about:  Environmentally extended Input-output analysis (EIO). National Accounts and environmental extensions. Construction of input-output matrices based on the national accounts. Application of EIO for environmental assessment of production and consumption activities on a sector, national regional and global level. The course gives the student insight about: How to assess environmental repercussions in large production networks. Material flows in an economy. Emissions associated with the production of traded goods. Skills: The course should enable the student to: Describe and solve production and consumption balances as a set of linear equations (basic matrix algebra). Assess the environmental impacts associated with production and consumption activities. Read and interpret scientific papers in environmental input-output analysis. Use python programming for the required modeling and presentation of results. General competence: The course should give the student insight on: The environmental impacts of production and consumption.

## Recommended previous knowledge

Linear algebra and programming. A basic understanding of economics. An introductory course in environmental science or environmental economics. One of the following courses or equivalent: TEP4223 Life-Cycle Assessment, TIØ4120 Operations Reasearch. Contact main lecturer for inquiries regarding prerequisites. Input Output methodology is largley based on matrix multiplication. We reccomend revising some basic matrix-vector operations from [Khan Academies Multiplying Matrix Video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:multiplying-matrices-by-matrices/v/multiplying-a-matrix-by-a-matrix).
